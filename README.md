_[Conjure](https://github.com/palantir/conjure) support for Rust._

## conjure-rust

`conjure-rust` is an [RFC 002](
https://github.com/palantir/conjure/blob/master/docs/rfc/002-contract-for-conjure-generators.md)-compliant CLI, which can
be used via a build tool like [gradle-conjure](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-conjure), or manually:

```
Generate Rust code from a conjure IR file

Usage: conjure-rust generate [OPTIONS] <INPUT_JSON> <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>

Arguments:
  <INPUT_JSON>        Path to a JSON-formatted Conjure IR file
  <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>  Directory to place generated code

Options:
      --exhaustive[=<EXHAUSTIVE>]  Generate exhaustively matchable enums and unions [default: false] [possible values: true, false]
      --stripPrefix <prefix>       Strip a prefix from types's package paths
      --productName <name>         The name of the product
      --productVersion <version>   The version of the product
      --crateVersion <version>     The version of the generated crate. Defaults to `--productVersion`
  -h, --help                       Print help
```

## conjure-codegen

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/conjure-codegen)

`conjure-codegen` is the library which turns a Conjure IR file into Rust code. It powers the `conjure-rust` CLI, but
can also be used on its own in e.g. build scripts as an alternative approach. See its documentation for more details, as
well as examples of generated code.

## conjure-error

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/conjure-error)

`conjure-error` is the runtime support library that the errors generated by `conjure-codegen` depend on. It defines
various standard error types and functionality to serialize and deserialize errors.

## conjure-http

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/conjure-http)

`conjure-http` is the runtime support library that the service clients and resources generated by `conjure-codegen`
depend on. It defines interfaces used by the underlying client and server implementations.

## conjure-object

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/conjure-object)

`conjure-object` is the runtime support library that the objects generated by `conjure-codegen` depend on. It reexports
the various third party types that correspond to Conjure primitives.

## conjure-serde

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/conjure-serde)

`conjure-serde` provides wrapper types for serde `Serializer`s and `Deserializer`s which adjust behavior to match
Conjure's expectations around binary data, non-finite floating point values, and unknown fields.
